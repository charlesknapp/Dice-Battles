## Simple Game Rules

- The game has 2-players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score
- However, if the player rolls a 1, all their round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which switched to the opponent and adds their round score.

- The first player to reach 100 points on FINAL score wins the game
