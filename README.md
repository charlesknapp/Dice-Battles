## Simple Game Rules

- Two players battle against each other in rounds.
- Each turn, a player may roll the dice as many times as they want. Each roll gets added to their total score.
- However, if the player rolls a #1, all their rolled score is lost for that round. Then it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which switches to the opponent and sums their round score.

- The first player to reach 100 score wins the game!
